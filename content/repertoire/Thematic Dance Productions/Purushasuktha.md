### Purushasuktha

The Mahabharata says, whose prowess not even all the gods can ever imagine. Such is the sage to whom Purushasuktha was revealed and who then gave expression to it as the hymn on the Supreme Purusha. Purushasuktha is a unique depiction of the Supreme Personality, using 4 different techniques or paths to realise the ultimate. The paths being: Vedic Rituals, Yoga, Music, and Dance. Purushasuktha is a pioneering experiment which blends all the four paths in a single production.
