## **Sharat R Prabhath:**
---
Sharat has had the fortune of being very closely associated with Indian arts and culture from a very young age. He began his training in Carnatic classical music under the able guidance of Dr Hamsini Nagendra. He now continues to learn under Karnataka Kalashree â€“ Tirumale Srinivas.

Sharat is also undergoing training in the classical dance style of Kathak for many years under the able tutelage of the famous dancing duo, Smt. Nirupama and Sri. Rajendra and now continues to learn under the maestro of Jaipur gharana - Pt. Rajendra Gangani (Kathak Kendra, New Delhi). Apart from being a performer, Sharat also takes a special interest in directing dance musicals and one such spectacular trend-setting production co-directed and co-choreographed by Sharat is Kathaastra, which created several benchmarks in the field of dance and theatre.
