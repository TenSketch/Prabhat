## About
---
&emsp; &emsp; Karnataka’s **_Haridaasa’s_** cult arouses varied questions in one’s mind. The literary works of great saint poets of Karnataka answer questions relating to spiritual experiences, knowledge of Tantra, Vedic wisdom, Societal Culture, Music, Dance, theatre and the like. But, the prime purpose of _Haridaasa_ literature is to expand one’s life and/or spirit. Hundreds of thousands such unanswered questions pertaining to creation, sustenance, and destruction are answered using simple words of _Haridaasas._ And the popular medium which was/is used to propagate the truth was/is “HARIKATHA.”

Harikatha, thus is a famous art of storytelling that requires tactful rendering of stories accompanied  music and dance. _Harikatha_ demands from the performer Knowledge of Sanskrit, the epics and puranas, the Vedas, music, dramatics, and dance, besides an overall interest and understanding of culture and philosophy. This composite art form, popularly known as “One Man theatre” narrates eye-opening truths of the universe using colourful stories imbibing all the 9 rasas or qualities. Thus, a _Harikatha_ exponent shoulders the responsibility of transforming the society into a better place.

India, a country that personifies Vedic wisdom, on the other hand also propagates a contrary idea of devotion. This movement of _Bhakti_ grew in the southern part of India, and Karnataka is the state that contributed the most in the movement with _Haridaasa kruthis, Abhangs, vachanas, Carnatic kruthis_ and many others.

The land also produced the father of Carnatic music, Saint Poet Purandara Dasaru, who propagated _Harikatha_ and created the rich lineage of _Harisaasas._ The tradition of _Harikatha_ thus grew and flowed through Vijaya Dasaru, Mohana Dasaru and up to the realised soul Rama Dasaru - who further expanded the territory by indoctrination the famous Harikatha duo Vankanna Das and Venugopal Das, who further extended the lineage by giving _deeksha_ to the brothers, Gopinath Das and Jayasimha Das, who established the renowned art organization, Prabhat Kalavidaru with their brothers Aacharya Karigiri (Eldest) and Dwarkanath (Youngest).

Hailing from the same lineage of Saint poet _Purandara Dasaru_, and the illustrious family of Prabhat, Daasacharya Sharat R Prabhat, currently carries on the ancient tradition of Harikatha under the guidance of his father, Aacharya Raghavendra J Prabhat.
