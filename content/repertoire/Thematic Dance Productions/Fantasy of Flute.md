### Fantasy of Flute

An imaginative and fantastical dance musical - Fantasy of Flute personifies the beauty of love through music. Every being in love with the ultimate seeks to possess his/her love completely. In the advent of possession, one will have to lose love. The same phenomenon is seen in “_Bhagavatha_” - where _Bhagavan Vyasa_ beautifully explains the theory of absence and presence through the story of Lord Krushna. The fantasy of Flute is a contemporary presentation of the traditional story from _Bhagavatha Purana_ depicting theory of absence and presence.
