## **Sharat R Prabhath:**
---
Sharat has had the fortune of being very closely associated with Indian arts and culture from a very young age. He began his training in Carnatic classical music under the able guidance of Dr Hamsini Nagendra. He now continues to learn under Karnataka Kalashree – Tirumale Srinivas.

Sharat is also undergoing training in the classical dance style of Kathak for many years under the able tutelage of the famous dancing duo, Smt. Nirupama and Sri. Rajendra and now continues to learn under the maestro of Jaipur gharana - Pt. Rajendra Gangani (Kathak Kendra, New Delhi). Apart from being a performer, Sharat also takes a special interest in directing dance musicals and one such spectacular trend-setting production co-directed and co-choreographed by Sharat is Kathaastra, which created several benchmarks in the field of dance and theatre.

An all-rounder in a true spirit, Sharat, also performs the challenging art of Harikatha and pursues the same under the adept supervision of his father, Aacharya Raghvendra J Prabhat. It is this ability of his to juggle many talents which has made him an appreciative exponent of Harikatha. His great grandfather Venkanna Das, belonging to the rich lineage of Saint Poet Purandara Dasaru (Father of Carnatic Music) and Vijaya Dasaru was largely instrumental in popularizing the rich tradition of Harikatha in Karnataka. Now, Sharat carries the responsibility of preserving and developing the legacy of his ancestors on his steady shoulders.

A favourite among audiences, Sharat has also made a mark as a creative director, music composer, dance choreographer and an actor who has worked with top directors of cinema like Sri. Nagabharana, Sri Dwarkish, Sri. Dinesh Babu - to name a few.
