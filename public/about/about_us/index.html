<p>The Group consists of 100+ artists, playback singers, yoga experts, animators and technicians. Another important feature of Prabhat is its superb presentation of almost all the classical forms of dance. Traditional and appropriate costumes in all their gorgeousness, exhaustively researched and thoroughly well-rehearsed lend an air of authenticity to the systems suitably made use in their dance dramas.</p>

<p>Prabhat has widely travelled the World and presented cultural programs for prestigious festivals, international symposiums, and cultural events and in various occasions in different parts of the World like USA, Switzerland and other European Countries, Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries.</p>

<p>Today, Prabhat is an institution of International standard and its achievements in the theatre world have been quite outstanding. “Prabhat” is literary “The Temple of Art” where hundreds of young men and women throng for training in theatre arts. There is a fully equipped stage props arena, costumes unit, make-up, training classes, Abhinaya, dance, music, drama, yoga courses, and recording studios.</p>

<p>Since 1930, Prabhat is constantly contributing to the field of art and all the auxiliary wings of the same. Prabhat is renowned as the pioneers in creating marvels on stage with unprecedented stage techniques, concept, music, dance, lights, costumes and the like.</p>
